## 2020 Delaware hackathon

The problem:

Watergroep is the biggest supplier of drinking water in Flanders and provides drinking water to 3,2 million customers across 180 Flemish municipilaties.
The public work performed by employees of the Watergroep can be accompanied by risk of physical harm.
To avoid these incidents employees are trained continuously and are to follow safety regulations.
VR could offer an opportunity to train their employees in a safe and controlled environment without risk of physical harm.

We mainly focused on creating a web platform where users can follow their own progress and that of their colleagues.
To increase user engagement and retention we used gamification tactics.

Finally to improve accessibility we also included some fun mini games that would be available across platforms in an attempt to engage users even after working hours.

Thank you **Delaware** for organising this hackathon.
Thank you **Watergroep** for this opportunity and the helpful feedback provided throughout the challenge.

And of course thank you *Kasra, Reinaert and Jan*, my team mates during this hackathon.
